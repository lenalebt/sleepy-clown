# Sleepy Skunk
Sleepy Skunk is an activity tracker. It analyzes sets of GPX
files. In the end, it should be a server-side-software to get
a fitness tracking server that gives you control over your
own data. You should be able to add activities through a simple
POST to the correct URL.

Tracking yourself is cool, but giving away your
data is more like ðŸ’©.
